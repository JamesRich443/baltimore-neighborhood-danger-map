# baltimore-neighborhood-danger-map
I created an interactive Map that outlines the top 10 worse and best neighborhoods in the city of Baltimore using the folium library in python.
I used violent crimes as a measure for the rankings the source for the best https://upgradedhome.com/safest-neighborhoods-in-baltimore/ and the
source for the worse https://www.areavibes.com/baltimore-md/most-dangerous-neighborhoods/
